    <h2>Cheems is the Shiba Inu Dog.</h2>
    <p>
      Balltze appears as the Internet meme character Cheems, whose name comes
      from his taste for "cheemsburgers" [sic]. The character adds the letter
      "m" into words as he speaks.[6] The meme was first posted to the
      r/dogelore subreddit on Reddit in June 2019.[4] The image used for the
      meme was uploaded originally on Balltze's Instagram account in 2017, and
      shows him sitting on the floor.[5] Cheems also features in the "Swole Doge
      vs Cheems" meme in which a muscular version of Doge represents something
      considered better in the past, and Cheems represents its current, lesser
      state.[5] The meme became viral in mid-2020, during the COVID-19
      pandemic.[11][12] In another meme format, Godzilla and King Kong represent
      two competing concepts, while Cheems armed with a baseball bat is the
      winning third concept, chasing the other two away.[13] In 2020, another
      meme circulated, in which Cheems hits another dog with a baseball bat
      causing the onomatopoeia "bonk", while saying "go to horny jail"; the meme
      is posted in response to sexually suggestive messages.[5] The Guardian
      journalist Caleb Quinley noted this image in protests against the 2021
      Myanmar coup d'Ã©tat.[14] Cheems appeared in several other memes in the
      Spanish-speaking world, including saying "no puede ser" ("It cannot be")
      and "me da amsiedad" ("It gives me amxiety" [sic]).[15][16] In 2021,
      Spain's public broadcaster RTVE wrote "What is clear is that a meme is
      worth more than a thousand words and Cheems and Doge now form part of
      Internet popular culture, reinventing themselves constantly to brighten
      our days or put us in our places".[5] Balltze's owner Kathy's favourite
      Cheems meme was one in Spanish, in which he takes a bath and says "Could
      you carry on scrolling? It's just that I'm taking a bamth [sic]".[4] Kathy
      initially did not understand the Cheems memes for their absurdist nature.
      She later signed deals with a management company and an American toy
      company, as well as making T-shirts which benefitted local canine
      charities.[4] Cheems inspired cryptocurrency such as Cheems Inu and
      Cheemscoin. Parth Dubey of the International Business Times wrote that
      they were part of "a number of wannabe dog-themed coins" competing against
      Dogecoin and the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency.[17]
